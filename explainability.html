            <h2>Model</h2>
            <p>The utilized model is a Random Forest Regressor. It works by training a large number 
                of decision trees on different subsamples of the dataset and features. Predictions are made by averaging over the trees. 
                This is preferable over a single decision tree as it avoids overfitting on the training data.</p>
            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>I scraped the data from two sources:
                <ul><li>Player data from <a href="https://www.futbolfantasy.com/"><b>FutbolFantasy</b></a></li>
                    <li>Match data from <a href="https://fbref.com/en/"><b>FBREF</b></a></li></ul>
                The resulting merged dataset has a row for each player performance, which is the target variable 
                and is to be predicted with the other columns, which exclusively contain information that is known before 
                the match starts (see features below).
            </p>
            <p>The Features used for this model are the following: 
                <ul><li><b>Player Name:</b> Label encoded player names</li>
                    <li><b>Position</b> Label encoded position</li>
                    <li><b>Home?:</b> Binary, is 1 when the match is played at the home stadium</li>
                    <li><b>Team Id</b></li>
                    <li><b>Opponent Id</b></li>
                    <li><b>Points_TminX:</b> Points achieved by the player in the last three matches</li></ul> 
            </p>
            <h2>Explainability / Interpretability</h2>
            <p>Random forests are not intrinsically interpretable since their prediction
                results from averaging many decision trees. One way to get a notion of how the model is making predictions is to look
                at how much an input variable (feature) influences the output. This can be done by computing the mean decrease in impurity after a split for each feature. 
                Scikit-Learn offers an implementation, the results are shown in the table to the right.
